General FAQ
===========

* What is a session?
	Sessions are logical data stream connections and the EMSX API supports failover betweeen physical connections. During this failover, EMSX API will handle re-subscriptions for the end application.

	If you are using multiple bloomberg API services, it is recommended to use separate sessions to avoid 
	delaying a fast stream with slow one. For most design, it's best to have separte session for 
	real-time data vs. EMSX API or reference data service. 

* Should I open and close sessions as needed?
	No, typically opening and closing a session is expensive for both the client's application and for Bloomberg back-end and thus unnecessary for most application designs while using EMSX API. 

* How do I specify a ticker?
	The EMSX_TICKER field should be specified either as a FIGI, or as a full parsekeyable value, including security, exchange and asset class, e.g.:  "IBM US Equity". Failure to provide an explicit value can lead to unpredictable behaviour.
	
* Why can I not subscribe using ticker and fields like other APIs?
	The EMSX service only allows users to subscribe to their own Orders and Routes (placements). Most 
	applications will use only two subscriptions, one for Orders and one for Routes (placements). A list 
	of EMSX fields is required when creating the subscriptions.

* Why can’t I see my orders and or routes in EMSX?
	The most common cause is that the user is connected to the BETA machines on the API side, whilst 
	using the PROD machine on the terminal. Switching one of these will normally resolve the problem.

* What happens when I subscribe to route level element on the topic string of my order subscription and vice versa?
	Your subscription will fail and will generate error similar to the following:

.. code-block:: python

		reason = {
			errorCode = 3
			description = "Invalid field passed in: Field=|EMSX_MOD_PEND_STATUS|"
			category = "-13"
		}

* **How do I connect to the BETA machine of the terminal?**
	Use the function DGRT Y087<GO> on the terminal, followed by EMSX<GO>. This will connect that terminal 
	window to the EMSX BETA machine. Please note that this only applies to that particular terminal 
	window only. To return to PROD system on the terminal, type DGRT OFF<GO>

* How do I connect to PROD or BETA in the API?
	Two separate services are provided. These are ``//blp/emapisvc`` (PROD) and ``//blp/emapisvc_beta`` (TEST)

* How do I match my requests to responses?
	This is done in the same was as for other Bloomberg API services, with the use of ``CorrelationID``.

* What broker or simulator do I use?
	When first enabled for BETA access, client will generally be enabled for BMTB or other internal 
	Bloomberg simulator codes. A new development broker has recently been added called the API. To be 
	enabled for other brokers in the LIVE environment, clients should contact the EMSX Help Desk.

* How do I test my application with these simulators?
	Test brokers (BB, BMTB, EFIX and API) are automated systems that respond a request in a predetermined 
	way, based on the specified security in the request. Each test broker has a set of documented 
	behaviors that clients can take advantage of to create test cases. These documents are currently 
	provided on request.

* Why am I not seeing events that affect my Routes?
	This is normally caused by only having a subscription for Orders. A separate subscription is needed 
	for route messages when using our programmable interface.

* Why am I still seeing orders that I deleted or have completed?
	Orders that were manually deleted, or completed in a previous session, will continue to transmit on 
	the order. Check the ``EMSX_STATUS`` of the returned message to confirm if this is a live order. 
	These orders will cease to report between 24 and 48 hours after they are deleted depending on the 
	nature of the order.

* Why is the value of a field returned as blank / zero?
	This normally means that the user has not subscribed to that field in the original subscription. This 
	can also mean that the user did not subscribe to the filed in the first place or is requesting for a 
	static field.

* Why is a field not being returned?
	Some fields are specific to either Orders or Routes. You cannot subscribe to an Order field in the 
	Route subscription and vice versa. 

	The type of message will also dictate which fields will be returned. For ``NEW_ORDER_ROUTE`` and 
	``INIT_PAINT`` messages, all fields will be returned. However, for ``UPD_ORDER_ROUTE``, the user will 
	only receive a small number of static fields along with all those fields deemed to be ‘dynamic’, 
	meaning they can change during the lifetime of the order or route.

	This is one of the reasons as why the user is encouraged to maintain their own image of and order or 
	route within their application.

* How do I receive Fill messages?
	Currently, the easiest way to track individual fills is to use the ``//blp/emsx.history`` service 
	using request/response service calls. 
	
	However, please do not use this as a replacement for the route subscription. Anyone constantly calling the history service and abusing the history service will be shut down by Bloomberg.
	
	The other option is to use the `route subscription`_ service. Each individual fill events will generate a ``UPD_ORDER_ROUTE`` 
	the message, with the applicable changes to the order and route data.

.. _route subscription: https://emsx-api-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/programmable/emsxSubscription.html#description-of-fills-using-route-subscription

* I do not see the fill information for one of my team member when I call the history service using team name.
	A UUID's fills are only stored if any of the following criteria are met:

	1. The user has at least one Export Fill profile in ``EMSI<GO>``, or
	2. The user belongs to a team that is setup for team fill export, or
	3. The user is an EMSX API user, i.e., ``EMSS<GO>`` internal settings show "Enable EMSX API" to be true.

	If the above criteria are not met, there will be no fills data history service can call to export.

* How do I route a complete basket?
	The term basket here is defined as a way to send the entire group of order into a single basket to a 
	broker destination or to a broker algorithm, which supports basket. The term basket here is not 
	intended for those who want to tie a particular group of orders into a trading strategy.

	Currently routing a basket is a two-step process in EMSX API. First, the user will need to use 
	``CreateOrder`` request to create the order and include the ``EMSX_BASKET_NAME`` in the field. To route 
	the order, the user can use either ``GroupRouteEx`` or ``GroupRouteWithStrat`` and include the 
	``EMSX_SEQUENCE`` number inside the array.

	If the user misses an ``EMSX_SEQUENCE`` number inside the specified basket, the particular missing 
	order will not be sent as part of the basket. This is the same logic used on EMSX<GO> for basket creation
	and basket submission.

* How long do DAY orders and complete orders stay on the blotter and in the API?** (Status = 8)
	In the old logic, the DAY orders stayed 4 hours after the exchange closed. The new logic is to extend 
	this to 8 hours after the exchange closed. Expired orders are deleted after 2 days. For expired 
	orders, when user gets ``INIT_PAINT``, the will get updates for those expired orders with status=8.

	For partially filled orders delete will modify amount down to the filled amount and that order will 
	not disappear and will be treated as a filled order. The Excel Add-In currently removes anything in 
	the blotter with Status=8.

* Why do I get “Internal error. Please contact customer support”?
	Unfortunately, this is a generic error message, which can be caused by a number of reasons. However, 
	the most common is that the user has failed to provide a mandatory field with a request.

* Why do I get “Customer ABCDE is not validated for ETORSA”?
	Client must sign a Bloomberg Electronic Trading & Order Routing Service Agreement before they can be 
	enabled for EMSX API access.

* Why do I get “User ABCDE is not permitted for the API”?
	EMSX Help Desk must enable users for EMSX API access via EMSS.

* Why do I get “User NOT Enabled to route to this broker by EOR (ENAB).”?
	Users must be enabled for specific brokers. This is done by EMSX Help Desk support for internal 
	simulator codes and by the broker for their own production codes.

* I am enabled but I get a red bar on the bottom when I click on the EMSX button.
	
	This is usually due to the following issues.

	* BBCOMM failed to establish a session. For this please see the next section on restarting BBCOMM
	
	* The ETORSA/FIET paperwork is not in file. Every EMSX API user’s firm will need to sign ETORSA and or FIET before using the EMSX API. Please click Help Help in EMSX<GO> and have the Trade Desk personnel check for this legal check.
	
	* The desktop prevents any third party WPF components from running.  This is usually tied into the PC’s image. This will usually cause an exception in the System.Windows.Media.Composition library. This will usually require reinstall of .NET 3.5 SP1, hardware display drivers, and DirectX libraries.

* How do I restart bbcomm?

	* Close all instances of Excel, Word and PowerPoint.
	* Open task manager and kill bxlaui.exe and bxlartd.exe.
	* Open a command prompt and type bbstop
	* In the same command prompt, type the command bbcomm. BBCOMM should report that it is running successfully and should not return. 

* How do I regenerate apiregistry.ini file?

	Open regedit from RUN window and Clear the "APIRegistryCRC32" registry value located at 
	"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Bloomberg L.P.\Office Tools\Settings" or 
	"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Bloomberg L.P.\Office Tools\Settings" on Windows 7.

* How do I modify GTD to day order?
	Set ``EMSX_GTD_DATE`` to "-1" or -1 or any negative GTD date will reset the order to day order.

* How do I modify or reset the stop price of an order?
	Set ``EMSX_STOP_PRICE`` to "-1" or -1 

* How do I reset my order from Limit to Market?
	``EMSX_LIMIT_PRICE = -99999`` is only required when modifying *from* LMT to something else

* How do I set 0 limit price for futures spread orders?
    ``EMSX_LIMIT_PRICE = -99999`` needs to be set, otherwise the 0 limit price will be ignored.

* How is ``EMSX_RELEASE_TIME`` used?
	``EMSX_RELEASE_TIME`` is in ``HH:MM`` format. For the API it is defaulted to the exchange time. This 
	only works on requests that are routable from EMSX API. Thus, it will not work on CreateOrder 
	request. Since the field is an integer, it should be forammted as ``1101`` for ``11:01``.

* Are ``EMSX_TICKER`` and ``EMSX_SIDE`` elements always available on the subscription service?
	No, any fields that are static are not always returned.

* Can update events come before the ``INITIAL_PAINT`` or new event?
	Yes, this wasn’t the original intention, however, due to current EMSX back-end, the update ``Event 
	Status = 7`` messages can come before ``INITIAL_PAINT`` ``Event Status=4`` or New ``Event Status = 6``

* Are ``INITIAL_PAINT`` messages always first?
	No, you can receive any route messages before the order message with ``INITIAL_PAINT``.

* Is there any downtime for EMSX API service?
	Yes, generally for EMSX services, it is down during machin maintenance on Saturday from 1pm to 5pm 
	Eastern Standard Time. For API routers, the routers are turned from Sunday US between 9am-1pm US 
	Eastern Standard Time. During the weekend turnaround, services are  down during this time time and 
	there will be no access to the service. The dependencies here are on the the machines the services 
	resides and not the service itself.

* Is there a community project based on EMSX API?
	Yes, there is a MIT licensed community project. It's called `EasyMSX`_.

.. Excel Add-In FAQ
.. ================

.. * I don't see the EMSX button on my Excel Add-In

.. This is mostly due to the user not being enabled for EMSX API. Click Help Help on EMSX<GO> and ask the EMSX Help Desk personnel to see if your UUID is enabled for EMSX API Excel Add-In. If the user has multiple Excel Add-Ins, the EMSX button will be under the Trading Icon.

.. * I am a Bloomberg AIM user and I am not able to connect from the Excel Add-In.

.. This is mostly often due to the AIM user not being able to connect to the beta environment (Y087).  For AIM, users they will need to test in production since there are no AIM instance in the beta environment (Y087). 

.. image: /image/registry.png

.. One of the ways to solve this is by going into the registry edit by clicking Start and type “regedit”.

.. image: /image/regedit.png

.. Once in the regedit.exe, click Alt-F and type “EmsxSystem”.
